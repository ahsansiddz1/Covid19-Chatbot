# Anything About Covid19 - Chatbot Application

## Overview
Corona Virus is the talk of the hour currently. It has affected so many lives all 
around the world. Some people do not have any information about COVID-19. I created a chatbot that responds to queries 
regarding the Corona Virus data to get the live status. It is a user-friendly platform, so that people of any category can easily interact with it.
I implemented this chatbot from scratch using CYK Parse algorithm, defining grammar and lexicon rules. For the data, I scrapped the https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ website. Then, mapped the parsed setence to regex patterns to get the response to the questions from the scrapped data.
